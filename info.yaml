# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
# Before changing this, please reach out to us on discord to discuss your design.
  tiles: "1x1"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# Keep a track of the submission yaml

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Uses time-multiplexed neurons composed of multiple compartments to solve QUBO problems.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      A python script is provided to generate a QUBO problem and send it to the chip. The chip will solve the problem and send the result back to the python script. The python script will then print the result.
